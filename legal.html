        <h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>
        <p>Please read these Terms of Use (these "Terms") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "Spotify Service") and any music, videos, podcasts, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service (the "Content").</p>
        <p>Use of the Spotify Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, which are hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms.</p>
        <p>By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.</p>

        <h4 id="service-provided"><a href="#service-provided">Service Provider</a></h4>
        <p>These Terms are between you and Spotify AB, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53, Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

        <h4><a href="">Age and eligibility requirements</a></h4>
        <p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 13 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age in your home country) or older, (2) have parent or guardian consent if you are a minor in your home country, (3) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (4) reside in a country where the Service is available. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times If you are a minor in your home country, your parent or guardian will need to enter into these Terms on your behalf. You can find additional information regarding minimum age requirements in the registration process. If you do not meet the minimum age requirements then Spotify will be unable to register you as a user.</p>

        <h1><a href="">2. The Spotify Service Provided by Us</a></h1>
        <h4><a href="">Spotify Service Options</a></h4>
        <p>We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free-of-charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed (the "Paid Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.</p>
        <p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.</p>
        <h4><a href="">Trials</a></h4>
        <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a "Trial"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the Spotify Premium Promotional Offer Terms.</p>

        <h4><a href="">Third-Party Applications, Devices and Open Source Software</a></h4>
        <p>The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications, websites, and services ("Third-Party Applications") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("Devices"). Your use of such Third-Party Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions and policies provided to you by the applicable third party. Spotify does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be compatible with the Spotify Service.</p>

        <h4><a href="">Service Limitations and Modifications</a></h4>
        <p>We use reasonable care and skill to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience. However, our service offerings and their availability may change from time to time and subject to applicable laws, without liability to you; for example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li>We aim to evolve and improve our Services constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features, subscription plans and promotional offerings).</li>
            <li>Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without notice.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify discontinues prior to the end of your Pre-Paid Period (as that term is defined in the Payments and cancellations section below), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period for any unused part of your then current Paid Subscription after such discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.</p>

        <p>Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties or events beyond our control.</p>
